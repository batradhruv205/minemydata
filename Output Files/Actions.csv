    SFC bans Samuel Lee Kwok Tung for eight months 
 19 Aug 2019 
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has banned Mr Samuel Lee Kwok Tung, a former account 
executive of DBS Vickers (Hong Kong) Limited (DBSVHK), from 
re-entering the industry for eight months 
from 17 August 2019 to 16 April 2020
 (Note 1).
 The disciplinary action follows an SFC investigation which found that Lee falsely stated that he was the 
client when confirming orders or acknowledging executed orders
 after placing such orders for a client via 
the telephone in 84 transactions between April 2015 and November 2015.
  As a result, the telephone 
records of DBSVHK gave the appearance that the trade instructions came directly from the client and that 
the trad
es had been confirmed with the client personally.
    The SFC considers that Lee™s dishonest act by falsely claiming to be the client called into question his 
fitness and properness to be a regulated person.
 In deciding the penalty, the SFC took into accoun
t all relevant circumstances, including Lee™s otherwise 
clean disciplinary record.

manner in which the trades were executed were agreed and coordinated beforehand. These trades were in 
substance off

November 2010 (Note 1).
 
In February 2011, the Securities and Futures Commission in Korea took enforcement action against 
Deutsche Secu
rities Korea Co. (DSK) for market manipulation through the exploitation of spot
-
futures and 
the setting up of speculative derivative position that benefited from the price fall of KOSPI200 during the 
closing auction period on 11 November 2010.
 
Traders of D
eutsche Bank AG located in Hong Kong were found to have originated the manipulative order 
instructions. 
 
The manipulation was referred to the prosecution office in Korea to criminally prosecute DSK 
and the involved traders for violation of the Financial In
vestment Services and Capital Markets Act.
 
Following a trial at the Seoul Central District Court, DSK and a Korea
-
based trader, who executed the 
manipulative orders, were found guilty of manipulating KOSPI200 for the purpose of making illegal profits 
for D
eutsche Bank AG and DSK. 
 
Deutsche Bank AG and DSK were ordered to forfeit about KRW43,695 
million profit derived from the manipulative trades. The traders in Hong Kong were not convicted because 
of their absence from the trial. However, the Court conclude
d that the traders in Hong Kong conspired to 
manipulate KOSPI200 (Note 2).
 
Ong was one of the traders in Hong Kong. 
 
He was responsible for the decision to liquidate the holding of 
Korean stocks, which caused KOSPI200 to fall 2.79%, and to establish an opt
ion position to profit from the 
KOSPI200 fall. 
 
His conduct has cast serious doubts on his fitness and properness to be a licensed person.

    SFC bans former responsible officer of Guosen Securities (HK) Brokerage Company, 
Limited for 10 months 
 23 Apr 2019 
  The Securities and Futures Commission 
(SFC) has prohibited Mr Su Xiqiang, former head of retail 
brokerage and responsible officer (RO) of Guosen Securities (HK) Brokerage Company, Limited (Guosen), 
from re
-entering the industry for 10 months from 17 April 2019 to 16 February 2020 (Note 1).
 The
 disciplinary action follows the SFC™s sanctions against Guosen over its failures to comply with anti
-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism (CFT) regulatory requirements when handling 
third party fund deposits between November 2014 and 
December 2015 (Note 2).
 The SFC found that Guosen™s breaches were attributable to Su™s failure to discharge his duties as an RO 
and a member of Guosen™s senior management (Note 3).
  In particular, Su, who was the most senior person overseeing Guosen™s reta
il brokerage business during 
the relevant time, failed to ensure that Guosen had:
  put in place effective policies to scrutinise and approve third party deposits received by retail 
clients; 
  implemented adequate systems an
d controls to identify and monitor third party deposits made into 
its bank sub
-accounts; 
  communicated and enforced its internal AML/CFT policies effectively; and 
  put in place proper procedures for reporting suspicious transactions. 
 Su also failed to sup
ervise staff members diligently to ensure they adhered to Guosen™s AML/CFT policies 
by:
  documenting the assessment of retail clients™ level of risk on money laundering and terrorist 
financing at account opening; and 
  regularly reviewing and updating existi
ng records of retail clients. 
 In deciding the disciplinary sanction, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including Su™s 
cooperation with the SFC in resolving its concerns and accepting the disciplinary action, as well as Su™s 
otherwise c
lean disciplinary record.

SFC obtains disqualification orders against former chairmen and chief executive 
officer of First China Financial Network Limited 
 
2 Oct 2015
 
 
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has obtained disqualification orders in the Court of First 
Instance
 
against three former directors of First China Financial Network Holdings Ltd (First China): Mr 
Wang Wenming, former Chairman, Mr Lee Yiu Sun, former Chief Executive Officer, and Mr Richard Yin 

 
 
Wang, Lee and 
Yin have been disqualified from being a director or being involved in the management of 
any listed or unlisted corporation in Hong Kong, without leave of the Court, for seven, five, and four years 
respectively (Notes 4 & 5).
 
The SFC alleged that Wang, Lee 
and Yin dishonestly breached their duties to First China by either 
concocting or lending support for the concoction of a non
-
existent oral agreement called the mutual 
understanding and agreement (MUA) that purportedly required First China to distribute a d
ividend of 
RMB18,692,000 to Fame Treasure Ltd, the seller of a company acquired by First China in 2007, which 
Wang was a majority shareholder.
 
 
The Court made the disqualification orders after finding that the MUA was a concoction and that the 
clarificatio
n announcement issued by First China on 16 December 2008 which stated that the MUA 
requiring the distribution was false or misleading in a material particular.
 
Earlier this year the Court ordered that Wang, Lee and Yin to repay First China a total sum of 
R
MB18,692,000, being the amount they caused First China to distribute to Fame Treasure Limited on the 
basis that the MUA existed. First China has received this money from Wang.
 
End
 
Notes:

Wang was appointed as the Chairman of First China on 12 June 2008 and
 
Lee was appointed as 
Chief Executive Officer on 28 September 2006.
 
 
Both of them resigned with effect from 22 
September 2015. Yin was appointed as Chairman of First China on 1 June 2005, re

    SFC bans Song Peng for 10 months 
 12 Jul 2019 
  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has banned Mr Song Peng, a former account executive of 
Phillip Securities (Hong Kong) Limited (Phillip Securities), from 
re-entering the industry for 10 months from 
12 July 2019 to 11 May 2020 for breach of the SFC™s Code of Conduct (Notes 1 to 3).
 The SFC found that Song effected transactions in a client™s securities account and margin account between 
April 2015 and May 201
6 on a discretionary basis without obtaining the client™s prior written authorization, 
nor with the knowledge and approval of his then employer.
 Although the client had verbally authorized Song to trade in the accounts on a discretionary basis, the 
absence
 of a written authorization prevented Phillip Securities from monitoring and supervising the 
operation of the accounts, and deprived the client from protection against
 the risk of unauthorized trades 
carried out in his accounts.
 In deciding the penalty, th
e SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including the duration of 
Song™s misconduct and his otherwise clean disciplinary record.

for a friend, and agreed not only to bear any losses that might result from her investment but also to 
distribute to her investment 
return on a monthly basis.
 
 

$50,000 into his account according to their agreement.
 
About a year later, when she approached Poon to retrieve her original investment and the return, she was 
told that he had en
tered into some binding options contracts which had to remain open until their expiry 
date as early termination would lead to significant losses. 
 
Poon later admitted that the options contracts 
were fictitious; he made them up because he wanted to delay th
e payment to his friend.
 
 
Poon eventually 
repaid her the original investment and the return after the SFC commenced an investigation into the matter.
 
During the investigation, Poon initially lied to the SFC that he conducted all securities and futures 
tran
sactions through his account at Phillip Securities (Hong Kong) Limited, but he later admitted that the 
transactions were in fact conducted through another corporation which was neither licensed nor registered 
with the SFC.

SFC obtains disqualification orders against former chairmen and chief executive 
officer of First China Financial Network Limited 
 
2 Oct 2015
 
 
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has obtained disqualification orders in the Court of First 
Instance
 
against three former directors of First China Financial Network Holdings Ltd (First China): Mr 
Wang Wenming, former Chairman, Mr Lee Yiu Sun, former Chief Executive Officer, and Mr Richard Yin 

 
 
Wang, Lee and 
Yin have been disqualified from being a director or being involved in the management of 
any listed or unlisted corporation in Hong Kong, without leave of the Court, for seven, five, and four years 
respectively (Notes 4 & 5).
 
The SFC alleged that Wang, Lee 
and Yin dishonestly breached their duties to First China by either 
concocting or lending support for the concoction of a non
-
existent oral agreement called the mutual 
understanding and agreement (MUA) that purportedly required First China to distribute a d
ividend of 
RMB18,692,000 to Fame Treasure Ltd, the seller of a company acquired by First China in 2007, which 
Wang was a majority shareholder.
 
 
The Court made the disqualification orders after finding that the MUA was a concoction and that the 
clarificatio
n announcement issued by First China on 16 December 2008 which stated that the MUA 
requiring the distribution was false or misleading in a material particular.
 
Earlier this year the Court ordered that Wang, Lee and Yin to repay First China a total sum of 
R
MB18,692,000, being the amount they caused First China to distribute to Fame Treasure Limited on the 
basis that the MUA existed. First China has received this money from Wang.

  The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has banned Mr Vincent Ng Lok Kan, a former licensed 
representative 
of Sun Hung Kai Investment Services Limited (SHKIS), from re
-entering the industry for 30 
months from 27 September 2019 to 26 March 2022 (Note 1).
 The disciplinary action follows an SFC investigation which found that Ng, an account executive of SHKIS at 
the material time, placed a number of buy orders for a warrant through a client™s account on 27 February 
2015, causing the price of the warrant to increase significantly.
  Ng then immediately sold his entire 
personal holdings in the warrant to the client. In
 doing so, he made a profit of $14,510 while his client 
suffered a nominal loss of $13,040 (Note 2).
 The SFC considers Ng™s conduct in ramping up the warrant™s price to facilitate the offloading of his 
personal holdings in the warrant for his own benefit a
nd to the detriment of his client dishonest and unfair to 
the client.
  Ng™s conduct was also unfair to other market participants because it interfered with the 
impartiality and objectivity of the normal price formation, and may have affected their trading 
strategy and 
investment decision in the warrant (Note 3).
 The SFC also found that Ng effected transactions in the client™s account on a discretionary basis without 
obtaining the client™s prior written authorization, and without the knowledge and approval o
f SHKIS.
  This 
prevented SHKIS from monitoring and supervising the operation of the account and, in turn, deprived the 
client of SHKIS™s protection in monitoring the discretionary trades conducted by Ng in his account (Notes 4 
& 5).
 In deciding the sanctio
n against Ng, the SFC took into account all relevant circumstances, including the 
client™s financial loss resulting from Ng™s conduct, his relative inexperience in the industry at the time of his 
misconduct, and his otherwise clean disciplinary record.

The SFC investiga
tion found that shortly after BYD Company Limited announced on 23 May 2014 a 
placement of shares to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, Wan incorrectly represented to 
some placees that the placing shares allotted to them through the placement cou
ld be sold on 28 May 2014 
without violating the short selling restriction under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Notes 3 & 4).
 
 
Three placees proceeded to sell a total of 2,300,000 placing shares before completion of the placement 
when the shares were
 
still subject to conditions and could not be sold until 30 May 2014.
 
The SFC considers it is imperative that all licensed representatives understand the short selling restriction 
because short selling may carry serious consequences for the uncovered short
 
seller.
 
 
Wan did not have an adequate understanding of the short selling restriction and had failed to ascertain 
when the placement would become unconditional such that the placing shares could legitimately be sold by 
the placees.

and regulatory risks and fell short of the standard expected of a licensed representative under the Code of

1 Mar 2016
 
 
The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has reprimanded and fined Ms Wan Xing $200,000 for 

 
The SFC investiga
tion found that shortly after BYD Company Limited announced on 23 May 2014 a 
placement of shares to be listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, Wan incorrectly represented to 
some placees that the placing shares allotted to them through the placement cou
ld be sold on 28 May 2014 
without violating the short selling restriction under the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Notes 3 & 4).
 
 
Three placees proceeded to sell a total of 2,300,000 placing shares before completion of the placement 
when the shares were
 
still subject to conditions and could not be sold until 30 May 2014.
 
The SFC considers it is imperative that all licensed representatives understand the short selling restriction 
because short selling may carry serious consequences for the uncovered short
 
seller.
 
 
Wan did not have an adequate understanding of the short selling restriction and had failed to ascertain 
when the placement would become unconditional such that the placing shares could legitimately be sold by 
the placees.
 
 
In deciding on the sanc

and regulatory risks and fell short of the standard expected of a licensed representative under the Code of 
Conduct. The SFC also took into account that Wan showed remorse for
 
her conduct (Note 5).
