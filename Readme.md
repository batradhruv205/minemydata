This project attempts to see whether Hong Kong SFC licensee holders are awarded enough disciplinary actions. Information about licensee holders and their disciplinary actions are publically available on the SFC website. However, there is no consolidated list of all licensee holders or disciplinary actions.
The approach used in this project is to start from David Webb's Webb-Site. Webb-site has a large and well-organized database of companies and license holders which is a good starting point for such a project.

The project is 

league table of all companies along with the number of SFC licensees associated with each company (https://webb-site.com/dbpub/SFClicount.asp).
